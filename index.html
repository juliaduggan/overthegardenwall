            Over the Garden Wall is my all time favorite show and this website will just be an overview of the show. Each seperate page will contain the summaries of the episodes (there are only 10 so probably two per page) and then potentially my thoughts/easter eggs that I have found:
            <ul>
                <p>Episodes 1 and 2</p>
                <p>Episodes 3 and 4</p>
                <p>Episodes 5 and 6</p>
                <p>Episodes 7 and 8</p>
                <p>Episodes 9 and 10</p>
            </ul>
        </p>
